Instructions to build and run executabel:
  1. To build makefile type: cmake .
  2. To build executable type: make
  3. To run executable type: dijkstra-benchmarks

It is the intention with this project to explore the possibilities of som advanced cpp programming koncepts. The concepts explored used are - template classes, exceptions, boost::bind, boost::signals2, moving, stl algorithms, stl containers, stl iterators, traits, variadics, compile time if's, polymorphic resource managment.
